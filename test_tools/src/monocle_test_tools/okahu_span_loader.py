        """Build FluentTestCases from the traces recorded for a workflow.

        One test case per fact in the window. How the facts are found depends on
        the level:

        - ``traces`` (the default): a trace is its own fact, so
          ``OkahuSpanLoader.get_trace_ids`` enumerates them and each has one
          trace's spans.
        - anything above a trace (agent requests, sessions, ...):
          ``get_fact_ids`` enumerates them from the fact ids API, then each
          fact's traces are looked up and *all* their spans concatenated -- the
          combined set is what describes that fact.

        Either way the spans are read by ``FluentTestCase.from_spans``, which
        fills in the agents invoked, the tools they called and the tokens
        consumed. Finally, only when ``check_eval`` is set,
        ``/v1/workflows/{workflow_name}/evals/report`` is asked about exactly those
        traces (``fact_ids``) and that eval, and the labels it returns become each
        case's expected results.

        The case's ``input`` stays the FactID rather than the prompt from_spans
        would derive: ``with_trace_source(testcase=...)`` needs a FactID, and
        ``run_agent(testcase=...)`` resolves one into the prompt itself.

        This is one request per trace plus one for the report, and above trace
        level another per fact to find its traces -- so a wide window is a lot of
        calls.

        Sending ``fact_ids`` takes the report endpoint OUT of discovery mode -- the
        absence of fact_ids is what selects discovery -- so it reports on traces
        already enumerated rather than re-discovering them.

        Without ``check_eval`` no report call is made at all and the cases
        carry no evals -- still fully described otherwise, and ready for
        ``run_agent(testcase=...)`` to replay. With one, a fact that has no
        labelled result for that eval is
        dropped: an empty ``evals`` list raises in ``check_eval``, so emitting the
        case would poison the suite it is meant to feed. The dropped count is
        logged rather than passed over in silence.

        Either way the result is directly parametrizable, being the shape
        ``with_trace_source(testcase=...)`` and ``check_eval(testcase=...)`` consume.

        A row's label is taken from ``authoritative.eval_result.label``, falling
        back to the newest entry in ``latest``. Rows with neither are skipped, and a
        fact left with no labelled eval yields no test case at all -- an empty
        ``evals`` list would raise in check_eval, so emitting one would only
        manufacture a broken case.

        Custom evals (``eval_id`` prefixed ``custom_evaluation__``) are returned
        like any other, by name. Okahu does not store their templates, so if such a
        name does not also resolve as a stored template, the case will fail when
        check_eval runs it rather than being filtered out here -- deliberate, so the
        report is reflected as-is instead of silently shrinking.

        Args:
            workflow_name: Okahu workflow / service name.
            start_time: Window start. Required -- discovery has no silent default.
            end_time: Window end. Required.
            fact_name: User-facing fact level, mapped to the Okahu name for the
                request. The returned FactIDs keep the user-facing name.
            category: Which eval runs to consider -- ``"llm"`` (the default),
                ``"manual"`` or ``"test"``, or a list of them. A bare string is
                wrapped, so this is always sent as a list.
            eval_filter: Optional ``eval`` filter narrowing which facts are
                considered at all -- passed to the fact/trace lookups as a query
                param. A bare eval name, or the API's ``name:label;name:label``
                form. Does not by itself cause any eval to be reported.
            check_eval: Which evals to report on, as a switch or a name.
                ``True`` reports every eval recorded for the fact level, a
                string reports only that one, and ``False``/omitted makes no
                report call at all. The labels become each case's expected
                results. ``"custom"`` is rejected: the report resolves a stored
                template by name and custom templates are not stored.
            compare_eval: Take the expected result from a *different* eval. The
                report is asked about this one and its labels are used, but each
                case still names ``check_eval`` -- so the case reads "run
                check_eval, expect what compare_eval recorded". That is the
                eval-tuning question: does a new template reproduce a golden
                one's labels? Requires ``check_eval`` to be a name, since there
                is otherwise nothing to attach the borrowed label to.
            page_size: Rows per page (server max 1000).

        Returns:
            One FluentTestCase per fact that has at least one labelled eval.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If check_eval is "custom", or fact_name is not
                recognized.
            AssertionError: If the report service cannot be reached or errors.
